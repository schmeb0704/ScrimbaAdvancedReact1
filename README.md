# D.R.Y. - Do not repeat yourself

# Inheritance 
drives OOP - classes and subclasses, instantiating objects etc.


# Composition
bits and pieces - frankenstein programming paradigm(?)

# Prefer Composition when writing React 
Facebook Team uses this as well

# Examples
1. Components with Props - it's like calling a function over and over. You can render depending on the props.
2. Children
3. Higher-order Components - Higher order functions
    â€¢ a function that takes a component as its first argument and returns a new component that wraps the given component, providing extra capabilities to it.
4. Render Props
